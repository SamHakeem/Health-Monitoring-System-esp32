# Health Monitoring System (ESP32-Based)

A customizable, open-source wearable system designed to monitor physical activity and vital signs in real time using the Arduino Nano ESP32 and various biomedical sensors. This project integrates embedded firmware with a Python desktop application via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for seamless data visualization and analysis.

---

## Features

- Real-time health monitoring via BLE
- Modular sensor support:
  - Heart rate & SpO₂ (MAX30102)
  - Body temperature
  - Motion (MPU6050 accelerometer + gyroscope)
  - Step count (basic pedometer logic)
- Cross-platform desktop GUI built with PyQt5
- Clean and extendable codebase for student projects, prototypes, and research

---

## Motivation

Designed as a final-year project for Electrical and Computer Engineering, this system demonstrates how open-source hardware and software can be used to develop affordable, customizable wearable health solutions. Inspired by commercial products like Fitbit and Apple Watch but focused on flexibility and learning.

## Hardware Used

| Component        | Model               |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Microcontroller  | Arduino Nano ESP32  |
| Heart Sensor     | MAX30102            |
| Motion Sensor    | LSM6DSOx            |
| Temp Sensor      | TMP117              |
| Power Supply     | LiPo Battery (3.7V) |

*Sensor use is configurable and adaptable based on available modules.*
